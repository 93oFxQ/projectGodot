## Camera2D+ Basic Functions
Camera2D+ provides a set of fundamental functions to help you create immersive visual effects in your game or project. Here are the core functions that allow you to generate the screen flash, screen shake, and cinematic effects:

1. ***flash(color: Color = Color.WHITE, duration: float = 0.5, hold: float = 0.0) -> void***:
    - The `flash` function triggers a screen flash effect with the specified `color`. By default, it uses white.
    - You can customize the `duration` of the flash effect, which determines how long the screen will remain flashed.
    - The `hold` parameter allows you to hold the flash effect for an additional duration before it begins to fade out.
    - This function is useful for highlighting important events or creating visual impact.

2. ***add_shake(strength: float) -> void***:
    - The `add_shake` function adds a shaking effect to the camera with the given strength.
    - You can call this function multiple times to intensify the shaking effect. For example, calling it with values 10 and 5 successively will result in a total shaking effect of 15.
    - Use this function to simulate various degrees of camera tremors.

3. ***set_shake(strength: float) -> void***:
    - The `set_shake` function sets the camera's shaking effect to a specific strength.
    - Calling this function more than once will overwrite the previous strength value. For instance, if you call it with values 10 and 5 successively, the total shaking effect will be 5, as the second call overrides the first.
    - Useful to prevent camera shake stacking.

4. ***set_follow_node(new_node_path: NodePath) -> void***:
    - With the `set_follow_node` function, you can designate a new node for the camera to follow.
    - For this feature to work effectively, ensure that the node to be followed is not a child of the camera, and the camera is not its child either.
    - Provide the node's path rather than the node itself to specify the target.

5. ***toggle_cinematic(horizontal: bool, vertical: bool = false) -> void***:
    - The `toggle_cinematic` function activates or deactivates the cinematic effect along the horizontal and vertical axes.
    - If you set `horizontal` to true, it enables the cinematic effect on the horizontal axis.
    - To enable both horizontal and vertical cinematic effects, set `vertical` to true as well.
    - This function is great for creating cinematic moments in your game, adding a touch of professional cinematography.
  
6. ***tilt_position(tilt_x: float, tilt_y: float) -> void***:
    - The tilt_position function instantly moves the camera by `tilt_x` on the X-axis and `tilt_y` on the Y-axis. It then smoothly returns to its original position, creating a bounce-like effect.
    - This function is excellent for adding dynamic responses to your game's events. For example, you can use it to intensify the impact of a music beat or enhance the feedback for in-game actions.

8. ***tilt_angle(tilt: float) -> void***:
    - The `tilt_angle` function provides a similar effect to `tilt_position`, but instead of altering the camera's position, it changes the camera's angle.
    - This function can be used to simulate dynamic camera adjustments in response to various game events. For instance, you can create a cinematic feel by adjusting the camera's angle during specific gameplay moments.

These core functions provide you with the building blocks to implement captivating visual effects and camera behavior in your Godot projects using the Camera2D+ plugin. Feel free to experiment and combine these functions to achieve your desired results!

## Exploring Additional Properties
The Camera2D+ plugin offers various additional properties that you can manipulate through the Godot Inspector. These properties allow you to fine-tune and customize your camera's behavior to suit your game's specific needs. Feel free to experiment and have fun adjusting these settings to achieve the desired visual effects and camera behavior.

### How to Use:
1. ***Open the Godot Inspector***: In the Godot editor, select the Camera2D+ node in your scene. You will find a list of properties in the Inspector panel.
